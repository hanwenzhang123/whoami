        <h2>Why I Love Coding?</h2>
        <img class="computer-img" src="images/computer.png" alt="computer-img">

        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was first time introduced to the computer at 5-year-old, I have been always fascinated with technology and how it functioned.</p>
        <p>I am a career changer - from being a Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW) to Software Developer.</p>
        <p>I initiated the idea of becoming a softeware developer from creating<a href='https://www.chappinesslifestyle.com' style="font-weight: bold; color:#11999E;">My Counseling Website</a>. Instead of building my counseling business, I fell in love with coding. </p> 
        <br>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <img class="education-img" src="images/education.png" alt="education-img">
        <p>I decided to obtaining a formal training and education to something I LOVE to do!</p> 
        <p>I have self-taught myself several computer programming concepts and languages prior to my second Master's degree in Software Development.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <img class="code-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fwbZnTftCXVocKzfxR/giphy.gif" alt="code-img">
        <p>Programming has been challenging but also incredibly rewarding and fascinating. It involves problem solving using both logic and reason, and has multiple paths to reach a solution. I like looking at what I have created but as well using logic to make an application work, I feel as if I’m fully flexing all my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <h3>Passion</h3>
        <p>It took me a while to realize I wanted to be a software developer, but I am glad I did without any regret.</p> 
        <p>I love coding, I enjoy coding, I code everyday, I am commited to coding, and I am learning forward!</p>
